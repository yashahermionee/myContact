                    Everyone has something he or she is passionate about and loves to do every time without getting bored, for me it is programming.

                    My first encounter with programming was in 3th grade school. I started out with Scratch, HTML, CSS and CodeBlocks. I am currently starting out on an online Whitehatjr course and it has all been a very wonderful experience. Writing codes gives me a sense of satisfaction, it is one of the things I feel I can do well and enjoy at the same time.

                    Programming requires a lot of time and dedication. </p>
                <p>Hardwork and diligence were my watchword as I began my "hello world" journey. I upheld this values like my life depended on it not only in learning programming but also in my studies.

                    My hardwork and diligence paid off as I saw considerable progress and improvements compared to when I started out. Seeing progress after watching tons of YouTube videos gave me joy and fueled my passion for programming. Success motivates me; when I record more successes than failures in trying out a particular thing it increases my love and passion for it. This explains my love and passion for coding. However failure fuels my desire to be successful, it offers a unique opportunity to learn from mistakes and develop strength.

                <h2>Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h2>
                <img src="https://blog.pcmbtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1.jpg"></img>
                <p>
                    Kalam had a dream which needs to come true by our efforts. â€œDr. A P J Abdul Kalam inspired me in a lot of ways but one thing which inspired me most was his reaction and adaptation to Failure. He never stopped working and dreaming just because of failure instead he worked harder.
